/*
C++ also has several container types that 
can be used for storing data. We will start 
with vectors, as these will be used throughout 
this lesson, but we will also introduce other 
container types as needed. Vectors are a sequence 
of elements of a single type, and have useful 
methods for getting the size, testing if the 
vector is empty, and adding elements to the vector.
